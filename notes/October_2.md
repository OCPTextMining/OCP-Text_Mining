# What we did this week
### Word2Vec

- Created a jupyter notebook to run the `Word2Vec` model from the `gensim` library.
- Performed a PCA to display the distribution of the 100 most used words. Using KMeans, we created 4 clusters.

Using this model, we can easily see which words are similar to a specific word. But, complicated to create word categories
