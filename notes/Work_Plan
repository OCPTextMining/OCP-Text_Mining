Work Plan:

1. Extracting tables from pdf files and making sense of them

2. Better extraction of text. Right now, the extracted text contains text from objects like footnotes and headers and
we need to get rid of these.

3. Better classification of entities. Using n-grams, if we can identify entities, convert them to one word objects
that are easily identifiable by the triple extractor, then the triples will be better.
    3a. Perhaps use word2phrase to identify word bigrams and trigrams and then make use of dbpedia objects to identify
     entities.
    3b. can we use word phrases for relationships as well? Needs to be explored.

4. Bigger data set. We are close to getting more data from researchgrid

5. Better parsing of sentences. Does a sentence make grammatical sense (can it be parsed)? Can we work on identifying
parts of speech to get a better sense of entities and relationships in the text?

6. Break long sentences into shorter, pithier, ones

7. triples identification
    7a. other methods for identifying triples. For example, word2vec to find object pairs in sentences and then
    extract relationships

8. Literature search:
    7a. Knowledge Graphs - the current state of research (Riya can work on collecting survey papers)
    7b. Natural Language Processing -  representational learning from natural language text
