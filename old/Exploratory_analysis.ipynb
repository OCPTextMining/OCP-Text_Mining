still but most believe and certainly hope that the impact on export sales will be negligible in the meantime signs of greater chinese export availabilility for august shipment has led to some weaker prices to be agreed for prompt shipment with reports of sales concluded in non indian markets in the 450s mt fob for the first time since august last year suppliers looking to place lighter coloured product or product that is not guaranteed 18 46 0 are having to concede lower prices indian buyers meanwhile are putting pressure on suppliers to lower prices further sensing the weakness creeping into the market for prompt shipment and looking for new prices closer to 470 mt cfr as yet these lower prices have not been agreed in either india or pakistan and it remains to be seen how much if at all suppliers need to offload prompt good quality darker material the lower prices do mean that chinese dap suddenly becomes interesting in the us and we can not rule out further sales for august shipment availability of dap for export should be at its peak at this time of year with no pull yet from the domestic season domestic demand will start towards the end of the month and run through september and october before petering out and will curtail export availablility accordingly during this period nevertheless gtis export data for august last year show some 800 000 mt chinese dap

though no substantial demand is reported usa imports covered declining domestic supply as noted in prior months the surge in imports of dap and map during the 2014 2015 us fertilizer year that ended june 30 made up for lost domestic production and changes in the product mix away from dap and map by mosaic in recent years most of the cover came from china but russian and moroccan imports also

fob china but demand remains thin demand is even more elusive for granular 11 44 0 china suppliers to reclaim vat on exports latest reports from china on the issue of vat suggest that the new policy has now been finalised and formal publication of the details can be expected within a matter of days as has been discussed already the chinese government plans to re introduce vat on fertilizer sales this will take effect from september 1 and apply to domestic sales of all fertilizers at a rate widely expected at 13 but as yet the impact on exported product is less certain there is much speculation about the final details but one theory that is gathering traction is that suppliers may be able to reclaim any vat paid on exported product a theory which makes logical sense and which would mean that the new policy will have no significant impact on exported fertilizers aside from a minimal administrative cost without full knowledge of exactly how the new policy will be implemented it is impossible to estimate the eventual cost of the new vat policy to the phosphate producers and the ultimate impact on domestic and possibly export pricing nevertheless it is our understanding that producers already paying 17 vat on all purchased inputs will be able to offset this input vat against the cost of the eventual vat rate levied on domestic sales as such those integrated producers who have captive rock and or ammonia supply for example could be facing a higher cost increase from the new tax as they will have a lower input vat cost levied on feedstock to offset against vat on sales smaller producers appear not to pay any vat on some or all of the inputs but the new policy is expected to bring tighter regulations to the vat system for domestic dap map sales producers are expected to pass the additional cost on to the buyer initial estimates suggest a higher cost burden from the new tax if introduced at 13 for most of the larger producers of up to 10 mt but for some it could be as high as 15 20 mt one interesting element for the phosphate and potash market is the impact the vat might have on imports currently morocco and tunisia have a long term government to government agreement to supply certain quantities of dap to china each year which is then subsidised some us cargoes are occasionally also imported into northern chinese ports ahead of the spring season the overall volume is not huge compared with export volumes more recently less than 250 000 mt per year but imports or rather sales of imported product are now expected to be subject to vat like all other fertilizers importers may have to pay 13 of the landed duty paid price which will make imports non viable unless the government will agree to www crugroup com phosphates weekly report 15 increase the subsidy to compensate for the additional cost give some rebate on the vat paid or else exempt imported fertilizers altogether from the new policy phosphoric acid middle east and africa
